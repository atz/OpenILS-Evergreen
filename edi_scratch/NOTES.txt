There is no such thing (yet?) as "push" from vendor of their EDI responses.  Basically
they just put them in an FTP directory somewhere that you are expected to check.  It
would be cool if there were a better way to do that like consuming some RSS feed or 
remote API callbacks.  

Evergreen will only support one delivery address per PO.  That limitation is based
on the mapping to the delivery address via the ordering_agency org_unit.  If items
need to be shipped someplace else, then they need a different PO, for now at least.

If we want to support multiple vendor profiles, then we drop the unique constraint
on SAN, add a new one on SAN + profile_code.  Profile code then goes in the template.
The template logic could get rather complex to support all the optional data elements.
